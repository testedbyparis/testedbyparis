# Hi, I’m Ana Carolina Paris 👋  

**Software QA Engineer** who believes **testing goes far beyond software**.  

I love exploring how **curiosity**, **detail**, and even **imperfection** shape not just better products, but better lives.  

On this page, you’ll find stories about **technology**, **growth**, **balance**, and the little experiments that help both **code** and **people** evolve.
