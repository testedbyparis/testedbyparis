## Hi, I’m Ana Carolina Paris, a Software QA Engineer who believes testing goes far beyond software.

I love exploring how curiosity, detail, and imperfection shape not just better products, but better lives.
On this page, you’ll find stories about technology, growth, balance, and the little experiments that make both code and people evolve.
